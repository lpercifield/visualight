1. Lights API
1.1. Get all lights
URL	/api/<username>/lights
Method	GET
Version	1.0
Permission	Whitelist
1.1.1. Description
Gets a list of all lights that have been discovered by the bridge.

1.1.2. Response
Returns a list of all lights in the system, each light has a name and unique identification number.

If there are no lights in the system then the bridge will return an empty object, {}.

Gets a list of lights that were discovered the last time a search for new lights was performed. The list of new lights is always deleted when a new search is started.

1.2.2. Response
Name	Type	Description
Lastscan	string	Returns “active” if a scan is currently on-going, “none” if a scan has not been performed since the bridge was powered on, or else the date and time that the last scan was completed in ISO 8601:2004 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss).
1.2.3. Response example
{
    "7": {"name": "Hue Lamp 7"},
    "8": {"name": "Hue Lamp 8"},

1.3. Search for new lights
URL	/api/<username>/lights
Method	POST
Version	1.0
Permission	Whitelist
1.3.1. Description
Starts a search for new lights.

The bridge will search for 1 minute and will add a maximum of 15 new lights. To add further lights, the command needs to be sent again after the search has completed. If a search is already active, it will be aborted and a new search will start.

When the search has finished, new lights will be available using the get new lights command. In addition, the new lights will now be available by calling get all lights or by calling get group attributes on group 0. Group 0 is a special group that cannot be deleted and will always contain all lights known by the bridge.

1.3.2. Response
Contains a list with a single item that details whether the search started successfully.

1.3.3. Response example
[ { "success": { "/lights": "Searching for new devices" } } ]
1.4. Get light attributes and state
URL	/api/<username>/lights/<id>
Method	GET
Version	1.0
Permission	Whitelist
1.4.1. Description
Gets the attributes and state of a given light.

1.4.2. Response
Name	Type	Description
State	state object	Details the state of the light, see the state table below for more details.
Type	string	A fixed name describing the type of light e.g. “Extended color light”.
name	string 0, 32	A unique, editable name given to the light.
modelid	string 6, 6	The hardware model of the light.
swversion	string 8, 8	An identifier for the software version running on the light.
Pointsymbol	object	This parameter is reserved for future functionality.
The state object contains the following fields

Name	Type	Description
On	bool	On/Off state of the light. On=true, Off=false
Bri	uint8	Brightness of the light. This is a scale from the minimum brightness the light is capable of, 0, to the maximum capable brightness, 255. Note a brightness of 0 is not off.
Hue	uint16w	Hue of the light. This is a wrapping value between 0 and 65535. Both 0 and 65535 are red, 25500 is green and 46920 is blue.
sat	uint8	Saturation of the light. 255 is the most saturated (colored) and 0 is the least saturated (white).
xy	list 2..2 of float 4	The x and y coordinates of a color in CIE color space.

The first entry is the x coordinate and the second entry is the y coordinate. Both x and y are between 0 and 1.
ct	uint16	The Mired Color temperature of the light. 2012 connected lights are capable of 153 (6500K) to 500 (2000K).
alert	string	The alert effect, which is a temporary change to the bulb’s state. This can take one of the following values:
“none” – The light is not performing an alert effect.
“select” – The light is performing one breathe cycle.
“lselect” – The light is performing breathe cycles for 30 seconds or until an "alert": "none" command is received. 

Note that in version 1.0 this contains the last alert sent to the light and not its current state. This will be changed to contain the current state in an upcoming patch.
effect	string	The dynamic effect of the light, can either be “none” or “colorloop”. 

If set to colorloop, the light will cycle through all hues using the current brightness and saturation settings.
colormode	string 2, 2	Indicates the color mode in which the light is working, this is the last command type it received. Values are “hs” for Hue and Saturation, “xy” for XY and “ct” for Color Temperature. This parameter is only present when the light supports at least one of the values.
reachable	bool	Indicates if a light can be reached by the bridge. Currently always returns true, functionality will be added in a future patch.

    }
}
1.4.4. Notes
Note the usage of the colormode parameter: There are 3 ways of setting the light color: xy, color temperature (ct) or hue and saturation (hs). A light may contain different settings for xy, ct and hs, but only the mode indicated by the colormode parameter will be certain to give the active light color.

1.5. Set light attributes (rename)
URL	/api/<username>/lights/<id>
Method	PUT
Version	1.0
Permission	Whitelist
1.5.1. Description
Used to rename lights. A light can have its name changed when in any state, including when it is unreachable or off.

1.6. Set light state
URL	/api/<username>/lights/<id>/state
Method	PUT
Version	1.0
Permission	Whitelist
1.6.1. Description
Allows the user to turn the light on and off, modify the hue and effects.

1.6.2. Body arguments
Name	Type	Description	
on	bool	On/Off state of the light. On=true, Off=false	Optional
bri	uint8	The brightness value to set the light to.

Brightness is a scale from 0 (the minimum the light is capable of) to 255 (the maximum). Note: a brightness of 0 is not off.

e.g. “brightness”: 60 will set the light to a specific brightness	Optional
hue	uint16w	The hue value to set light to.

The hue value is a wrapping value between 0 and 65535. Both 0 and 65535 are red, 25500 is green and 46920 is blue.

e.g. “hue”: 50000 will set the light to a specific hue.	Optional
sat	uint8	Saturation of the light. 255 is the most saturated (colored) and 0 is the least saturated (white).	Optional
xy	list 2..2 of float 4	The x and y coordinates of a color in CIE color space.

The first entry is the x coordinate and the second entry is the y coordinate. Both x and y must be between 0 and 1.
If the specified coordinates are not in the CIE color space, the closest color to the coordinates will be chosen.	Optional
ct	uint16	The Mired Color temperature of the light. 2012 connected lights are capable of 153 (6500K) to 500 (2000K).	Optional
alert	string	The alert effect, is a temporary change to the bulb’s state, and has one of the following values:
“none” – The light is not performing an alert effect.
“select” – The light is performing one breathe cycle.
“lselect” – The light is performing breathe cycles for 30 seconds or until an "alert": "none" command is received.	Optional
effect	string	The dynamic effect of the light. Currently “none” and “colorloop” are supported. Other values will generate an error of type 7.

Setting the effect to colorloop will cycle through all hues using the current brightness and saturation settings.	Optional
transitiontime	uint16	The duration of the transition from the light’s current state to the new state. This is given as a multiple of 100ms and defaults to 4 (400ms). For example, setting transistiontime:10 will make the transition last 1 second.	Optional
1.6.3. Body example
{
    "hue": 50000,
    "on": true,
    "bri": 200
}
1.6.4. Response
A response to a successful PUT request contains confirmation of the arguments passed in. Note: If the new value is too large to return in the response due to internal memory constraints then a value of “Updated.” is returned.

1.6.5. Response example
[
    {"success":{"/lights/1/state/bri":200}},
    {"success":{"/lights/1/state/on":true}},
    {"success":{"/lights/1/state/hue":50000}}
]
1.6.6. Notes
A light cannot have its hue, saturation, brightness, effect, ct or xy modified when it is turned off. Doing so will return error 201.

There are 3 methods available to set the color of the light – hue and saturation (hs), xy or color temperature (ct). If multiple methods are used then a priority is used: xy > ct > hs. All included parameters will be updated but the ‘colormode’ will be set using the priority system.
